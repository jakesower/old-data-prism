# Data Prism

Data Prism is a tool to help people make sense of tabular data. A running copy can be found [at my website](https://dataprism.jakesower.com). It runs completely in the browser, but may expand to cover server side aspects in the future.

## Project Status

This repository is under active development. There are parts of the website that are incomplete, and the suite of operations, charts, and analyses are limited.

That said, the most important structures are in place and working. I will be updating the `Learn` section to included tutorials that will showcase existing functionality, which covers enough cases to be genuinely useful. Currently there is only one available, but it will expand.

## TODO

- Tutorials that better showcase functionality.
- Bugs in tracking chart state.
- Export Remix recipes via JSON.
- UI for importing Remix recipes.
- Improve error message handling and validation.
- Browser history tools for better linking/navigation.
- UI and back end for data and recipe hosting.
- Include more Remix operations, charts, and analyses.

## Libraries Used

- Cycle.js
- moment.js
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Babel
- And several minor ones found in package.json
