# Remix

Remixing allows data to be transformed, combined, and otherwise manipulated.

## Primary Source

There is always a primary source that is used as a starting point for a remix. The source can then be acted upon by numerous types of *operations* that transform it in some fashion to produce a new table.

### Joins

Join operations take the active table and another source table to create a table that considers information from both.

### Filters

Filters remove a number of rows from table.

### Derivers

Derivers create a new column of values based on existing values within the table.

### Groupings

Groupings take individual rows from a table and bundle them together into groups based on some criteria. These groups can then be operated on by aggregators to produce a new table.
